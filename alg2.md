# Algorithm 2: ULM Fit Model

## Summary

> The ULMFit was much harder to implement than expected. Most of the issues came from improper data conversion types and mismatches. Another limitation stemmed from the hardware limitations.

## General Stats

___

### Test 1

    Data Size: 500
    Accuracy: 50.7%
    
    Confusion Matrix (Diagonal): 
    [72   4]
    Confusion Matrix (Sum): 
    [139   11]

### Test 2

    Data Size: 1000
    Accuracy: 49%
    
    Confusion Matrix (Diagonal): 
    [145   2]
    Confusion Matrix (Sum): 
    [298   2]

## Results

> The overall performance leaves much to be desired. I'll have to look at it again in the future. But currently, the data accuracy peaks around 50%. Increasing the size may improve the accuracy.
