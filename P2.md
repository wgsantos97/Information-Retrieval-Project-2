# Project 2 Algorithms Outline

## Introduction

> For the sake of consistency, the text will all go through the same NLP Steps. So that means lower-case, removal of stop-words, tagging, and lemmatization.

## General Architecture

> Project II will follow this general structure

    > class Review
        Variables
            - book_id
            - title
            - rating
            - review_text
            - processed_text

    > class Project2
        Variables
            - json filename
            - List of Review objects
        JSON Processor
            - Converts the json data into a dictionary of Review classes where the key is the book_id of each class
        NLP Processor
            - returns the result of processing the 'review_text' into processed text data
    
    > class Base_Algorithm
        Variables
            - filename
        Process
            - converts the text_data into vector formats that the Machine Learning algorithms can use.
        WriteToFile
            - writes results into a given file through the Formatter.
        Learn
            - implemented by child class; processes the data and calls WriteToFile, passing in the results.
        Formatter
            - implemented by child class; Decides how the end result will be displayed

    > class Naive_Bayes : Base_Algorithm
    > class ULM_Fit : Base_Algorithm

    main
        - calls Project2 which will handle all the review processing and then feed it to the Naive_Bayes and ULM_Fit classes.

## Evaluation/Testing Method

> As mentioned before, we will use the 'rating' field in the data to measure the accuracy level of the ML algorithm. sklearn has a 'score' function that we can use to compare the results of what the algorithm returned against the expected output.
